$ cat /etc/services | less
# lsof -i    # list of open ports
# ss -tulpn  # ist all open TCP and UDP ports
# netstat -tnlup
# sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
# sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN


-a will show all sockets that are listening and all non-listening sockets too
-l only shows ports which are actively listening
-v means “verbose” and tells netstat to include additional information about any address families that are not currently configured
-t restricts the listing to TCP connections only
-u restricts the listing to UDP connections only
-n tells netstat to display the numerical addresses too
-p adds the process ID (PID) as well as the name of the program

By using nmap. Note. Nmap is capable of revealing a lot of information which can make system administrators think that you are of an ill intent. 
So, therefore, only use nmap on your local systems as done here.  # sudo nmap -n -PN -sT -sU -p- localhost
